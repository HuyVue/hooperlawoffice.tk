<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Transcript</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> We welcome now back into the Miron Construction Studio our friends Peter Harbach and Sarah Kons from Hooper Law Office. Sarah, Peter, welcome back to the show. Thanks for coming back you guys and thanks for everything, today, the three-year anniversary of Fresh Take today. So very excited about that and very thankful to Hooper Law Office for making that possible they have been great supporters and partners of the show for a long, long time. Really appreciative of that and thanks for being part of us here monthly. When you get to come in to chat, I really like it.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Thanks, Josh. Happy anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Couldn't do without you and it's been a really great partnership. So, I want to start here, I want to ask you what usually brings people to your office in the first place. How does it how do these conversations usually start? Is there a life event? Is there something in the news? What often will get people in that door for that first conversation?</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> There's usually one of three things. Either it is the decline of health of a loved one so they're coming in because there's something happening to somebody else. They've hit retirement. So retirement tends to mean I've got this list of things that I need to do, and dealing with planning my estate is one of those things. The third, and probably the most common one is people come in and say I just had to deal with my parents or my brother or whoever's estate. I don't want to do this to my family because it was very difficult. I want to make it as easy as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> So there could be sort of that acute need, somebody's condition changes. There could be the circumstance changing like retirement where you're like ok now is the time I'm going to start thinking about this or that last scenario and I'm not surprised that that's the most common is they've had to deal with someone else's vision lack of a plan or not outstanding planning and they don't want to do that same thing. They don't want to be in that same situation.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Exactly. And it happens pretty commonly and it's funny because the people said exactly what they say. I don't want to do this to, usually, my kids.</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> That's it, they don't want to put someone else in the situation. They just had to go through. So, do you find yourselves having to do some handholding and maybe some encouraging, saying "it's OK we're going to be able to do this"? Is there some panic usually when people come in? Is there a concern of that level?</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Not really. Usually, the panic is more in people that are dealing with the decline of health in other people. When people are being proactive it's almost a proactive interaction for them because it's "I want to be able to do this. This is a good thing that I'm doing in taking care of the people that I love and making things easier for them." So they leave the experience feeling very positive about what they're doing and like it's a good investment.</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> When people come in, Peter, for that first conversation. How long does that first meeting usually take, and what are you trying to accomplish in that first meeting?</p>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong> So we always block a two-hour period of time and a lot of people are surprised thinking "oh you know my situation this is simple, so I don't know in the world we are going to get through a couple of hours and do anything productive" And every time by the end of it they say "oh my god, there is so much more to this than what I expected. You brought up so many things that I didn't think of." But that's our job. If somebody can think of all of these things on their own, we wouldn't be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> Well that's really the point here and that's what we're getting into today. There are so many things even when something happens to bring the notion of estate planning front and center in their life whatever that might be, there's a lot of things that we're not thinking about in that process. [...] What are some of those things that people aren't thinking about?</p>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong> Well, you know, a lot of people will come in thinking "oh, you know I need to get a Will" or "It's been a lot of years since I've done a Will". [...] One of the first things is always, what if you don't die but you just need help? What if you're not in a position to be able to handle your financial assets and everything. Who do you Trust? Who are we gonna put in charge of your financial decisions and your health care decisions, to make sure that you've got a team built around you so that if you do decline, you've got people who are on deck who have the powers and provisions that they need to be able to do the best job in helping you.</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> Not to mention the powers you want them to have. The powers you have given them, the people you have selected.</p>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong> Yes, absolutely. Because one of the most overlooked things and we harp on this all the time, is that if you have any concerns about the costs of long term care there's provisions you could put within your estate plan that gives the family different powers to help you through that if suddenly you're facing long term care costs. And look, those could be very valuable [...] including setting assets aside to make sure that somebody does not completely run out of funds. But, they only have that power if it's explicitly within their Estate Plan.</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> That's right. That's where that proactive action is so important. What are some of the other things people are overlooking or not thinking about in the beginning stages, Sarah?</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Well, you know it's funny when I have a conversation with people, it's very common that they're immediately flipping to the financials. They want it while "everything's going to be really easy, I have everything at this bank and this advisor," and they're immediately talking about money but it's the people that are in your life that you end up planning around. The money is absolutely important and the property and everything else and there are legacy aspects to different things.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> And the financial side of it makes your<a href="estate-planning.html"> estate plan</a> work, but you're building it for people usually. You want to have the individuals in different roles and responsibilities, you want to make sure that you're including people that maybe aren't legal heirs of yours, or you have a different definition of family. So I mean, there are all sorts of examples of famous people that have passed away and they've lost contact with maybe their blood relatives. But the people that have surrounded them during their life and supported them are now completely left out because there was no estate plan. So it's kind of the same with people, it's the individuals in your life that you're fighting for.</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> I remember this from the process I went through in getting my plan in order. II was thinking too, "OK, I better have all my money my statements and forms and all these things." But that's later because in order to know what to do with those assets you need to know who I care about, what I want to accomplish, who I'm responsible for. Those big questions about the relationships. It's in my life. And, it's important now might seem easy. But, it's not always as easy as we think, is it? Those relationships are complex. </p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Exactly. And they go through changes.</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> Yes, that's the big one. So, talk a little bit about that. What are some of the changes people maybe not thinking about up front? Or, some of the specific circumstances that present challenges later.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> A lot of times we're talking about the people that they want to include. Do they have concerns about money management? Do they have someone that has a substance abuse issue in their family that they want to support health wise but not make things available for drugs or alcohol? Is it a relationship issue with one of the individuals, some potential divorce or something like that? Are there stepchildren that you consider to be children or grandchildren but wouldn't be included unless you specify it? So there can be a lot of different examples of what's happening with the different individuals. And then there's also kind of the proactive side of it as well. So making sure that when you're laying out your plan you have the roles and responsibilities specified. Peter was talking about making sure that different people have the authority to help you. Well, what about you helping other people? I talk all the time with clients that have kids that are between ages of 18 and 30. They're they're adults. They're legal adults but usually between especially 18 and 25 maybe they're not real adults yet.</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> Less and less each year. But this is important because you are deciding who's going to be responsible for your decision making and your finances. These are big decisions, and you want to make sure that you understand the options that you have. I think this is the most important part, there is not one tool. There are many, many, many tools. I know in our process, Sarah, my big one was my dog. I don't know if Leroy's going to be around longer than me. And I want to make sure he's cared for as long as he is around. So, we created a special pet trust that put some money aside, specifically for his needs, designated a series of people in order that are going to be responsible for that. And now I have total peace of mind that if I'm not here to pick care of him, someone is.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Well, and he had particular health issues that were a bit more expensive. So, sometimes when you're designating an animal with someone they're a great caretaker but they wouldn't have the resources to support an animal. So that's where that, in particular, would be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong> People make fun of the concept the pet trusts because they think of some eccentric old lady that leaves a million dollar to a couple of cats. But in reality, it's just allocating money so that you're certain that there is something there to provide for the manner of living for the pet so that they're taken care of and not you know dumped off of an animal shelter for lack of funds.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> This is particularly true. Yes, dogs and cats. But any exotic pets that do have special demands or needs... like horses.</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> Oh gosh, talk about the costs related there. I mean you're talking about a really big obligation. You don't want to just foist that on someone without appropriate resources go with it.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> And I do a lot of special needs planning and it's not unusual for there to be therapy animals. Horses are very common therapy animals, so making sure those are available for those people.</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> And if you want it to happen, when you're not here, it's got to be in the plan. And so, you've got to talk about it. You have to plan for it. And I highly recommend you talk to Peter and Sarah about it because they know the questions to ask. They understand the tools that are available.</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> Peter Sarah thanks so much. Always a pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong> Thanks, Josh.</p>

                    <p>I would have waited three months rather than just three weeks to have this conversation and receive all of this information. I had not realized there were other options. This was fantastic, and you have been a fountain of useful information. Especially in the area of planning around disabilities, whether young or later in life, there are not enough people like you for individuals or their families to speak with to get good information to make decisions on these issues.</p>

                    <p>We were referred to Attorney Sarah Kons at Hooper Law Office to develop a family trust that worked perfectly with our needs. Attorney Kons was extremely professional, knowledgeable, thorough and patient; taking the time to learn our situation in order to properly advise us of our options. The final product was well worth the effort and cost and will ultimately save our family members a great deal of trouble upon our passing. We recommend her highly to anyone seeking family counsel.

The team is also available to work with us as our lives and laws change to make sure our documents continue to meet our needs.

                    <p>We had been thinking about getting our will updated, our medical last wishes, and final estate planning in order. Hooper Law Office had an ad in our newspaper and it was at a time and place that we found very convenient. We were impressed with the seminar and the questions that were answered to our satisfaction. We decided it was time to make an appointment to see what it was all about. At the time, we were only going to get an idea of what it was all about. It was our first attempt to check out our thoughts. We wanted to know more. <br />
<br />
My wife and I made the free visit to see if we would be interested in Hooper Law Office to take care of our legal work. Wow, were we in for a surprise! Sarah Kons, was the attorney that we worked with. She gave us all the time we needed to know about us and what we were looking for. She was very thorough. She gave an overview of all the things we needed to think about.. We set up an example of what we would be facing. We decided to think it over.<br />

We were so comfortable with her that we decided to go ahead and get it done. It was an interesting journey from start to finish. There was no &quot;high pressure&quot; at all. We weren&apos;t ready for all the questions and paper work needed, but we soon found ourselves involved and excited to getting everything together. Sarah was a big help to us. We learned that Hooper Law Office is a team. That was important to us. The paralegal staff was very personable and helpful when we had questions. We appreciated their cheerful attitude. It gave us assurance that we made a very good choice when we chose Hooper Law Office. We are convinced that this was the Attorney and Group that would do a complete job for us. Peace of mind is important to us. We feel that we have that, and are happy to recommend Attorney Sarah Kons and her team Attorneys to take good care of our needs. </p>

                    <p> Our estate planning evolved over the years working with several attorneys at different periods of time. The plan was not thorough and incomplete. Now as a Certified Financial Planner, I understand the need for a highly qualified attorney for our estate planning needs.<br />
<br />
Through working closely with Attorney Foss Hooper on our plans, we developed a strong personal and profesional relationship. After a few discussions, Foss had a clear understanding of our goals in drafting our estate planning. This is our second marriage and we wanted to have fair and equal treatment for the children of our previous marriage.<br />
<br />
The plan is based on three important objectives for family wellness:<br />
<br />
1. An effective arrangement of care for family members in financial and health care issues.<br />
<br />
2. A tax efficient transfer of wealth to beneficiaries and charity.<br />
<br />
3. A legacy to leave.<br />
<br />
Attorney Hooper drafted four separate trusts:<br />
<br />
1. A Revocable Lving Trust which is fully funded.<br />
<br />
2. A Dynasty Trust protecting assets for multiple future generations.<br />
<br />
3. A Revocable Stand Alone IRA Trust designed for asset protection and to enhance wealth accumulation for beneficiaries of various ages.<br />
<br />
4. An Irrevocable Trust in conjuction with an ILIT as means for wealth transfer in eliminating estate and other taxes.<br />
<br />
Our estate planning is thorough and complete. We are comfortable, confident and satisfied with our comprehensive plan.<br />
<br />
We greatly appreciate Attorney Foss Hooper&apos;s professional expertise.<br />

                    <p>I thought I had our financial affairs in order, in case of our death, until I attended a seminar held by Sarah Kons of Hooper Law Office. That&apos;s when I learned I didn&apos;t know what I was doing. By the end of the seminar I wanted an appointment to have their professional help. All we had to do was give them our information and they handled everything so our trust was in order and we could relax knowing everything was being taken care of and done properly. Now when the time comes, our children, with minor help of Hooper Law Office, can take care of our estate with minimum time and effort. </p>

                    <p>We are nearing retirement age and realize our wills, made when our now adult children were young, needed to be updated. We attended a seminar about retirement at which the speaker stressed the importance of using a specialist for the preparation of wills, and other estate documents. Our son recommended Sarah Kons, an estate planning specialist with Hooper Law Office. We are so glad we consulted her and used her services. She is smart, organized and fully knowledgeable about all aspects of estate planning. She didn&apos;t &quot;sell us&quot; on anything, rather she educated us about our choices after carefully gathering all the facts about our situation. Her guidance and expertise were extremely valuable to us. The price was clearly laid out beforehand and there was no hidden or unexpected fees. She and her staff followed through promptly on every aspect of the plan. We highly recommend Sarah Kons to anyone who wants expert guidance and care with their estate planning.<br />

                    <p>My husband had to go into a nursing home suddenly due to health issues and I was no longer able to care for him at home. Due to the high costs of my husband&apos;s care, I was scared that all of the money we both worked so hard for would be gone within a short period of time. My daughter found Hooper Law Office. We were quickly put into touch with Sarah Kons and Kim Van Den Bosch-Jones. Within a couple of days we were meeting with them to put my finances in order. They were wonderful to work with. They explained everything in a language that I could understand. Because of all of their help assisting with the paperwork, contacting agencies, and setting up accounts, a lot of stress was taken of my shoulders, which I am grateful for. I appreciate all of the time and effort both Sarah and Kim have helped me and my daughter with getting all of our affairs in order. I can&apos;t thank you both enough!</p>

I was especially worried about the way everything was spelled out in legal terms. Sarah assured me that they would be there for me down the road. This was very comforting to me. This is a very troubling time for me and I am sure that Sarah has set up my trust to make mine and my daughters future much brighter with the loss of my wife and mother in the past six months. To learn Sarah&apos;s compassion all you have to do is read the letter in the office about her wonderful grandma. Sarah and her staff are great, Thanks.</p>

                    <p>Hooper Law Office was very informative on all areas of special needs trusts and regular trusts. Sarah and her paralegals were so quick to get back to us with more info than i had asked. I could not say enough about this law office. We were very impressed with every step we took. Thank you again for all your help.</p>
