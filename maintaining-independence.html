<p><strong>Attorney Sarah Kons appeared on <a href="https://www.whby.com/2020/07/07/fireworks-fight-ii-maintaining-independence-media-criticism/">WHBY’s Fresh Take with Josh Dukelow</a> to discuss maintaining independence and control throughout life.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong>  Fresh Take is brought to you by Hooper Law Office. Find their offices in Appleton, Oshkosh, or Green Bay. Or find them online at HooperLawOffice.com. For your elder law and estate planning needs, Hooper Law Office providing a pathway to your legacy. And providing great advice for maintaining your financial independence. That's what we're going to talk about right now as Sarah Kons from Hooper Law Office joins us on the Settlers Bank phone line. Sarah, welcome back to Fresh Take.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Hi, Josh. </p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> How are you doing today?</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> I'm doing well. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> I'm doing very well actually. We just got done talking about fireworks. Did you hear some fireworks in your neighborhood this weekend?</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> I did. Absolutely, I did. I saw quite a few pretty good ones actually. And I was surprised, because I kept asking people around me, "I thought those were illegal, weren't they?"</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> Indeed. Indeed, they are. And then we find out that [...] we talked last week about prosecutorial discretion on the show. I think that would be a topic that would apply to that question you had right there. </p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> I think you're right. </p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> Well we will leave the fireworks aside. But independence is the topic that we're talking about just as our nation has celebrated the anniversary of our Declaration of Independence. The idea of independence is important to estate planning as well. That's really what it's all about, isn't it, Sarah?</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> It really is, especially as you get older and you begin transitioning through different types of changes. As your health especially may change and you may need to transition through different types of living situations, you want to make sure that you are maintaining and exercising a strong amount of control and independence through those different types of changes. </p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> And it's these changes that we are often talking about when you join us here on the show, Sarah. These changes, as you mentioned, with living situation, with health, with capabilities and capacities and being able to describe in your plan ahead of time how you want things handled is a great way to make sure that your wishes are honored even if you aren't the one giving the directions.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Right. Even if you are not the person that is able to communicate what your decisions are at that point in your life, you want to have the ability to name the person that is speaking for you and be the one that has designated what are the powers and authorities that they have to either make decisions on your behalf or what are they able to access or control when it comes to the assets or property that you own or what it is that you want in terms of medical decisions. </p>
<p>So even if you're not at a point where you can communicate those decisions on your own, you have done all of that in advance so that you still have that measure of control. It's still your voice in that process even if it's not you actually communicating it. </p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> Yeah. And this idea of being able to have your wishes be honored throughout all the decisions in your life, that is really at the heart of estate planning. It's at the heart of what we talk about. And Sarah, Hooper Law Office is actually putting together a weekly webinar series this week talking about this idea of maintaining control. Walk me through a little bit some of these topics and what you're going to be sharing with those who attend.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> We are going to be doing basically for the month of July, different topics associated with maintaining independence. So we're going to be talking about maintaining financial independence, maintaining independence when it comes to your medical care, your health, maintaining independence as you age or if you have to experience any sort of transition into long-term care, and maintaining independence even if you have a loved one that maybe is providing care for you at some point. </p>
<p>So all of these are different situations that you may find yourself in where either you need to have prepared in advance in order to make sure that you are maintaining your own independence or there's something that you need to do to maintain a larger amount of your voice in that process just in case things change for you at that point in your life.</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> People who may be listening now, getting older, thinking about these sort of issues that might become irrelevant to their lives here in the not-too-distant future, it's not just those who are aging or who may need the care that need to understand these issues. It's those who may be providing their care in the future [...] their loved ones, their family members. They need to understand these issues too, don't they?</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Right. There's a series that we did not that long ago on the common mistakes that we see sometimes caregivers making when they're providing care for a loved one or some of the common mistakes we see our clients making when they're receiving care from a family member or a friend. </p>
<p>And unfortunately, most people find out that they've made these mistakes when there's something else they can do about it at a point where they're transitioning into care and they're seeking out accessing other benefits or other resources to assist them and obtaining different kinds of care. And they find out, "Oh, you weren't supposed to have done it this way." Or, "If you needed that, you were supposed to have titles to display or called it this." Or, "You were supposed to have this document in place in order to do it that way. And now this is the penalty for that." Or, "This is the result that you are going to end up getting because of what you didn't know at that time. </p>
<p>And unfortunately, there just isn't a, "Well you didn't know, so therefore, it's OK." They don't care that you didn't know. And I've seen a lot of really unfortunate situations with people where they honestly just had no idea. They were doing the best they could with the information that they have at the time. </p>
<p>And there's a lot of information out there. This isn't really a situation where you can't find any information about this. It's an over-abundance of information that's the problem. There's just so much information out there on what the best thing to do is or different types of programs that might be relevant to your situation at that time. </p>
<p>Different places [...] geography matters a whole lot when it comes to what information you're looking at. If you're reading something about Medi-Cal out in California, it has absolutely no relevance at all to Wisconsin. Because we don't use Medi-Cal. So if you're looking at that to guide you, you're going to have a problem. If it's older than 2014, for example, it's also going to be very out of date, because there were a lot of significant changes that happened then. Or significant changes that happened even more recently. So the age of what you're looking at has a big impact. </p>
<p>People are trying to navigate all of this the absolute best that they can, and they'll ask the same question of three different people and they'll still get three different answers. So they make the best decisions that they can at the time, but they can still end up in a position where they didn't realize that they needed to have done something a little differently.</p>
<p>So what we're trying to do is make sure that people are making the best decision they can with the best information they can in order to maintain a high level of control over their situation and maintain a degree of independence. Even if you're transitioning to different types of care, you still want to make sure that you are exercising control over your situation and that your family is able to say, "This is the style of life that this person wants, that this is the quality of life that they really need to have. So therefore, this is the situation we're going to make sure that they continue to have even as their health may change. Or they might transition to the higher levels of care. And that's really that it is that you're trying to create for yourself or for your loved one.</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> The July webinar series on maintaining control begins tomorrow, July 8th. And that is with maintaining control of your finances. One of the biggest questions we're all having, I think, as we head into retirement, will we have enough money? Maintaining control of the money you have, a key way to maintain that independence. That topic will be covered in the webinar tomorrow. You can get more information at <a href="http://estateplanninglive.net/">EstatePlanningLive.net</a> or call Hooper Law Office for more information (920) 993-0990. </p>
<p>Give them a call. Tell them you heard about it on Fresh Take, you want to sign up for the webinar to maintain control and independence. </p>
<p>We're talking to Sarah Kons with Hooper Law Office. When we come back, we're going to talk a little more detail about ways that people may lose their independence and what can be done if some aspects of independence have been lost or are being lost, what steps can be taken and what you can do. If someone has already lost some of their capacity, can you still help them maintain control as they age? We're talking about independence and maintaining your independence and control as you age. This is Sarah Kons from Hooper Law Office. We'll talk more about that when we continue with more Fresh Take after this on <a href="https://www.whby.com/">WHBY</a>.</p>
<p>[00:09:33] Break in the show</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> Real local radio helping you maintain your control and independence with Sarah Kons from Hooper Law Office talking estate planning and making sure that you keep control of your finances as you age. Sarah, you and Peter from Hooper Law Office are offering a series of webinars starting tomorrow with maintaining control of your finances. Folks can call Hooper Law Office, (920) 993-0990, to get signed up. The first 50 people to register get a free copy of your book, Your Life Your Legacy. </p>
<p>So let's sort of build a little excitement here, Sarah. Let's get people curious about what they might learn. Talk a little bit about some of the ways people can lose financial independence.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> People, I think, mistakenly believe that if they do planning or they put together like a financial power of attorney that they're, then, turning over the authority to do things or that they're turning over control to somebody else. So if they just don't name anybody to do anything, then they're keeping control in their hands. And by doing that, they're actually kind of doing the exact opposite. </p>
<p>It's not that if you later lose capacity, it means that you get to keep control over everything even if you lose capacity. It just means if you then lose capacity later on, your loved ones then are just going to go through the court process of guardianship to have a guardian named. And that process actually strips authorities from you as a person and gives them to somebody else to exercise on your behalf. And only with the court's approval are you able to get them back. </p>
<p>So it's actually a much more, almost heavy-handed process. It can be appropriate for certain situations, but if you don't do planning on your own to say, "These are the people that I trust. These are the powers that I give them to help me," is necessary. And by doing that, you're not giving up powers yourself. You're just sharing them with somebody else, if necessary, down the road. You're not avoiding the need to do that. You're just kind of putting your loved ones in a situation of having to use a much more heavy-handed process down the road. </p>
<p>So it really isn't a, "If I don't do this, it means everything stays with me." It's more of a, "If I don't do this and end up needing it, it's going to be a much more significant process." So it's really something people need to be aware of. "If I fail to take action and looking at what documents are out there [...] what are the ones that are really appropriate for me and my situation?" There are things that family members can do. They just might not be ideal or the best for your situation. </p>
<p>And there isn't one set of documents out there. It's not like there's one document that everybody has to do. Everybody's circumstances really dictate a different scenario or different set of documents. And you want to make sure that you know what it is that's right for you.</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> And Sarah, it sounds like based on what you're saying there, there are some situations or eventualities you may find yourself in that once you're in the situation, some of your options may be already foreclosed once you've gotten to that point. So you need to be planning ahead for if you find yourself in that scenario.</p>
<p>I'd imagine there's an endless series of "if" scenarios. How do you determine what you need to plan for and what is just too much?</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> A lot of it is just based on conversations, honestly, that we have with people. What is it that your life is like? Who are the people that are important to you? How is it that you spend your time? What is it that you commonly do when you travel? How far do you go? Do you spend a lot of time traveling? </p>
<p>What about the people that are close to you and the people that you trust? What are their lifestyles like? What is their availability like? </p>
<p>And this pandemic, I think, has also really highlighted availability as a big factor when it comes to especially financial planning. People that have been quarantined or stuck out of the country even and trying to get back into the U.S., their assets don't just go away or don't just stay on hold indefinitely. They need to continue to manage the things that they own. They still have responsibilities. And if they don't have people that can do that on their behalf or do that for them, they might not be able to do that from a long distance.</p>
<p>Some places, unfortunately, don't have great Wi-Fi. So being able to do online banking isn't always a reality if you're not in an area where that's possible. So having somebody else that has the authority to deal with your assets, to deal with your financial accounts, to file taxes for you, to do basic things like that can be really helpful even if it's just a situation where you're unavailable. It's not necessarily a health event where you're no longer able to participate. It's just you're not able to access something for a period of time.</p>
<p>In that scenario, you're also not likely able to sign something. There are a lot of exceptions that went into effect not all that long ago that allow a lot of different documents to be signed electronically, but unfortunately, estate planning documents don't tend to fall in that category. So you want to make sure that you appropriately sign some of these things before you're in a situation where you need them. Because the people that need to present them are the ones that have to have access to correctly sign documents.</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> So Sarah, if there's somebody listening right now and they are hearing what you're saying [...] you're describing some scenarios [...] and they are concerned that maybe they or a loved one is already beginning to lose some aspects of their independence, what can they do about that? What's that first step they should take?</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> One of the best things that you absolutely can do is talk to them about where they keep things. Where is it that they keep important records? Where is it that they keep their financial information or vital records like birth certificates or marriage certificates, military records, things that might become important down the road. Where is it that they keep important papers and documents? Is it in a safe where they're the only one that has the combination or they're the only one that has a key? Is it in a safe deposit box where nobody else has access? So where is it that you keep things?</p>
<p>What other professionals do you use? Do you work with a financial advisor? Do you have an attorney that you worked with to put together some planning documents? Who are these professionals? And then introduce the people that you're putting in these positions or the people that you trust to these professionals and give them permission to talk to this person so that this person, if they're your sort of go to, if you start to decline in health and this person's going to step in and be the one that's going to help make sure that you have the type of life and the quality of life that you really want. Being able to access people to help guide their decision and help understand what it is that they need to be doing can be invaluable to them. So introducing them to who these professionals are, connecting them with these people, making sure that these professionals are allowed to talk to them, all of those are just basic pieces of information that usually family members just don't have because they haven't had these conversations. </p>
<p>So starting with where do you keep things, who is it that you work with, what documents do you currently have in place, who is it that you have named, and how old are these document? Are these things that we can use easily at this point, or are they 15 years old and we're going to struggle to present them at a financial institution? </p>
<p>Doing a basic review, that can be extremely helpful. Let's say you work with an estate planning attorney, taking the person that you have named to act for you into the attorney's office and walking through your documents with them and the attorney so that the person understands what the documents are, what it is they're named to do, what it is they're authorized to do, what it is that you want them to be doing in these different situations, and give them the opportunity to ask questions. </p>
<p>Peter, I know, has said on your show a number of times a line that we tend to repeat pretty commonly, "A person cannot do a good job for you if they do not know that they have a job to do." So you need to make sure that you talk to people that you've named in your planning. And that's going to make a world of difference both to them and to the success of any plan that you have. </p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> We know those conversations can be difficult, but Sarah, you've explained just how important they are. And I appreciate you doing that. I encourage everybody to consider signing up for the estate planning seminar tomorrow. </p>
<p>And you can get signed up by calling Hooper Law Office (920) 993-0990. That's 993-0990. Get signed up for the estate planning seminar, Maintaining Control of Your Finances, July 8th.</p>

                <p>I thought I had our financial affairs in order, in case of our death, until I attended a seminar held by Sarah Kons of Hooper Law Office. That&apos;s when I learned I didn&apos;t know what I was doing. By the end of the seminar I wanted an appointment to have their professional help. All we had to do was give them our information and they handled everything so our trust was in order and we could relax knowing everything was being taken care of and done properly. Now when the time comes, our children, with minor help of Hooper Law Office, can take care of our estate with minimum time and effort. </p>

                    <p>I would have waited three months rather than just three weeks to have this conversation and receive all of this information. I had not realized there were other options. This was fantastic, and you have been a fountain of useful information. Especially in the area of planning around disabilities, whether young or later in life, there are not enough people like you for individuals or their families to speak with to get good information to make decisions on these issues.</p>

                    <p>Sarah Kons spent time with our family to understand our specific needs and the solutions required to meet those needs.  She and the paralegals updated all our legal documents (will, power of attorney, etc) and prepared a trust and special needs trust for us.  Because of this, we now have peace of mind that our family is protected when we die and we can leave what we want, to whom we want, when we want, the way we want.  The team is also available to work with us as our lives and laws change to make sure our documents continue to meet our needs. Since we&apos;ve created our documents, they&apos;ve conducted annual client update meetings to keep us informed of changes happening that might affect our plan.  We feel Hooper Law Office is helping us preserve our legacy!</p>

                    <p>We went to one of Hooper Law Office&apos;s free seminars and were very impressed with their knowledge, professionalism and the fact that they just work with estate planning.<br />

We decided to meet with Sarah Kons and move forward with our estate planning. Sarah and the Hooper Law Office Team answered all of our questions and concerns. They always had our best interest in mind.<br />
<br />
We highly recommend Hooper Law Office.</p>

                    <p>We had been thinking about getting our will updated, our medical last wishes, and final estate planning in order. Hooper Law Office had an ad in our newspaper and it was at a time and place that we found very convenient. We were impressed with the seminar and the questions that were answered to our satisfaction. We decided it was time to make an appointment to see what it was all about. At the time, we were only going to get an idea of what it was all about. It was our first attempt to check out our thoughts. We wanted to know more. <br />
<br />
My wife and I made the free visit to see if we would be interested in Hooper Law Office to take care of our legal work. Wow, were we in for a surprise! Sarah Kons, was the attorney that we worked with. She gave us all the time we needed to know about us and what we were looking for. She was very thorough. She gave an overview of all the things we needed to think about.. We set up an example of what we would be facing. We decided to think it over.<br />
<br />
We were so comfortable with her that we decided to go ahead and get it done. It was an interesting journey from start to finish. There was no &quot;high pressure&quot; at all. We weren&apos;t ready for all the questions and paper work needed, but we soon found ourselves involved and excited to getting everything together. Sarah was a big help to us. We learned that Hooper Law Office is a team. That was important to us. The paralegal staff was very personable and helpful when we had questions. We appreciated their cheerful attitude. It gave us assurance that we made a very good choice when we chose Hooper Law Office. We are convinced that this was the Attorney and Group that would do a complete job for us. Peace of mind is important to us. We feel that we have that, and are happy to recommend Attorney Sarah Kons and her team Attorneys to take good care of our needs. </p>

                    <p> Our estate planning evolved over the years working with several attorneys at different periods of time. The plan was not thorough and incomplete. Now as a Certified Financial Planner, I understand the need for a highly qualified attorney for our estate planning needs.<br />
<br />
Through working closely with Attorney Foss Hooper on our plans, we developed a strong personal and profesional relationship. After a few discussions, Foss had a clear understanding of our goals in drafting our estate planning. This is our second marriage and we wanted to have fair and equal treatment for the children of our previous marriage.<br />
<br />
The plan is based on three important objectives for family wellness:<br />
<br />
1. An effective arrangement of care for family members in financial and health care issues.<br />
<br />
2. A tax efficient transfer of wealth to beneficiaries and charity.<br />
<br />
3. A legacy to leave.<br />
<br />
Attorney Hooper drafted four separate trusts:<br />
<br />
1. A Revocable Lving Trust which is fully funded.<br />
<br />
2. A Dynasty Trust protecting assets for multiple future generations.<br />
<br />
3. A Revocable Stand Alone IRA Trust designed for asset protection and to enhance wealth accumulation for beneficiaries of various ages.<br />
<br />
4. An Irrevocable Trust in conjuction with an ILIT as means for wealth transfer in eliminating estate and other taxes.<br />
<br />
Our estate planning is thorough and complete. We are comfortable, confident and satisfied with our comprehensive plan.<br />
<br />
We greatly appreciate Attorney Foss Hooper&apos;s professional expertise.<br />

                    <p>I thought I had our financial affairs in order, in case of our death, until I attended a seminar held by Sarah Kons of Hooper Law Office. That&apos;s when I learned I didn&apos;t know what I was doing. By the end of the seminar I wanted an appointment to have their professional help. All we had to do was give them our information and they handled everything so our trust was in order and we could relax knowing everything was being taken care of and done properly. Now when the time comes, our children, with minor help of Hooper Law Office, can take care of our estate with minimum time and effort. </p>

                    <p>We are nearing retirement age and realize our wills, made when our now adult children were young, needed to be updated. We attended a seminar about retirement at which the speaker stressed the importance of using a specialist for the preparation of wills, and other estate documents. Our son recommended Sarah Kons, an estate planning specialist with Hooper Law Office. We are so glad we consulted her and used her services. She is smart, organized and fully knowledgeable about all aspects of estate planning. She didn&apos;t &quot;sell us&quot; on anything, rather she educated us about our choices after carefully gathering all the facts about our situation. Her guidance and expertise were extremely valuable to us. The price was clearly laid out beforehand and there was no hidden or unexpected fees. She and her staff followed through promptly on every aspect of the plan. We highly recommend Sarah Kons to anyone who wants expert guidance and care with their estate planning.<br />

                    <p>My husband had to go into a nursing home suddenly due to health issues and I was no longer able to care for him at home. Due to the high costs of my husband&apos;s care, I was scared that all of the money we both worked so hard for would be gone within a short period of time. My daughter found Hooper Law Office. We were quickly put into touch with Sarah Kons and Kim Van Den Bosch-Jones. Within a couple of days we were meeting with them to put my finances in order. They were wonderful to work with. They explained everything in a language that I could understand. Because of all of their help assisting with the paperwork, contacting agencies, and setting up accounts, a lot of stress was taken of my shoulders, which I am grateful for. I appreciate all of the time and effort both Sarah and Kim have helped me and my daughter with getting all of our affairs in order. I can&apos;t thank you both enough!</p>

                    <p>My experience with Hooper Law was superior and it was all made possible with how Sarah Kons put me at ease. I was especially worried about the way everything was spelled out in legal terms. Sarah assured me that they would be there for me down the road. This was very comforting to me. This is a very troubling time for me and I am sure that Sarah has set up my trust to make mine and my daughters future much brighter with the loss of my wife and mother in the past six months. To learn Sarah&apos;s compassion all you have to do is read the letter in the office about her wonderful grandma. Sarah and her staff are great, Thanks.</p>
