<p>In most "first marriages" <a href="estate-planning.html">estate plans</a>, the couple plans for the surviving spouse to have access to all of the assets at the death of the first spouse. Typically, the couple also wants the assets split equally among their children at the death of the surviving spouse, but such planning seldom meets the needs of "second marriage" families. A second marriage creates unique circumstances that require special planning. </p>
<p>Here are just some of the special planning circumstances that confront many couples in a second marriage:</p>
<ul>
<li>One spouse wants to keep property in his or her own name.</li>
<li>One spouse does not want to be responsible for the other's debts.</li>
<li>Each has differing investments philosophies.</li>
<li>They desire different beneficiaries for their life insurance policies, annuities, and retirement accounts.</li>
<li>They want their estate to be distributed to different beneficiaries (such as their respective children from their previous marriages, siblings, parents, or charities).</li>
<li>The difference in age between the children from the previous marriages and the children of the new marriage requires special planning for guardianships, college expenses, and the ultimate distribution of the inheritance. </li>
</ul>
<p>While these situations are common to most second marriages, every family is different and will have unique challenges that require special planning. </p>

                    <p>I would have waited three months rather than just three weeks to have this conversation and receive all of this information. I had not realized there were other options. This was fantastic, and you have been a fountain of useful information. Especially in the area of planning around disabilities, whether young or later in life, there are not enough people like you for individuals or their families to speak with to get good information to make decisions on these issues.</p>

                    <p>We were referred to Attorney Sarah Kons at Hooper Law Office to develop a family trust that worked perfectly with our needs. Attorney Kons was extremely professional, knowledgeable, thorough and patient; taking the time to learn our situation in order to properly advise us of our options. The final product was well worth the effort and cost and will ultimately save our family members a great deal of trouble upon our passing. We recommend her highly to anyone seeking family counsel. Thanks Sarah, pleasure working with you!! </p>

She and the paralegals updated all our legal documents (will, power of attorney, etc) and prepared a trust and special needs trust for us.  Because of this, we now have peace of mind that our family is protected when we die and we can leave what we want, to whom we want, when we want, the way we want.  The team is also available to work with us as our lives and laws change to make sure our documents continue to meet our needs. Since we&apos;ve created our documents, they&apos;ve conducted annual client update meetings to keep us informed of changes happening that might affect our plan.  We feel Hooper Law Office is helping us preserve our legacy!</p>

                    <p>We had been thinking about getting our will updated, our medical last wishes, and final estate planning in order. Hooper Law Office had an ad in our newspaper and it was at a time and place that we found very convenient. We were impressed with the seminar and the questions that were answered to our satisfaction. We decided it was time to make an appointment to see what it was all about. At the time, we were only going to get an idea of what it was all about. It was our first attempt to check out our thoughts. We wanted to know more. <br />
<br />
My wife and I made the free visit to see if we would be interested in Hooper Law Office to take care of our legal work. Wow, were we in for a surprise! Sarah Kons, was the attorney that we worked with. She gave us all the time we needed to know about us and what we were looking for. She was very thorough. She gave an overview of all the things we needed to think about.. We set up an example of what we would be facing. We decided to think it over.<br />
<br />
We were so comfortable with her that we decided to go ahead and get it done. It was an interesting journey from start to finish. There was no &quot;high pressure&quot; at all. We weren&apos;t ready for all the questions and paper work needed, but we soon found ourselves involved and excited to getting everything together. Sarah was a big help to us. We learned that Hooper Law Office is a team. That was important to us. The paralegal staff was very personable and helpful when we had questions. We appreciated their cheerful attitude. It gave us assurance that we made a very good choice when we chose Hooper Law Office. We are convinced that this was the Attorney and Group that would do a complete job for us. Peace of mind is important to us. We feel that we have that, and are happy to recommend Attorney Sarah Kons and her team Attorneys to take good care of our needs. </p>

                    <p> Our estate planning evolved over the years working with several attorneys at different periods of time. The plan was not thorough and incomplete. Now as a Certified Financial Planner, I understand the need for a highly qualified attorney for our estate planning needs.<br />
<br />
Through working closely with Attorney Foss Hooper on our plans, we developed a strong personal and profesional relationship. After a few discussions, Foss had a clear understanding of our goals in drafting our estate planning. This is our second marriage and we wanted to have fair and equal treatment for the children of our previous marriage.<br />
<br />
The plan is based on three important objectives for family wellness:<br />
<br />
1. An effective arrangement of care for family members in financial and health care issues.<br />
<br />
2. A tax efficient transfer of wealth to beneficiaries and charity.<br />
<br />
3. A legacy to leave.<br />
<br />
Attorney Hooper drafted four separate trusts:<br />
<br />
1. A Revocable Lving Trust which is fully funded.<br />
<br />
2. A Dynasty Trust protecting assets for multiple future generations.<br />
<br />
3. A Revocable Stand Alone IRA Trust designed for asset protection and to enhance wealth accumulation for beneficiaries of various ages.<br />
<br />
4. An Irrevocable Trust in conjuction with an ILIT as means for wealth transfer in eliminating estate and other taxes.<br />
<br />
Our estate planning is thorough and complete. We are comfortable, confident and satisfied with our comprehensive plan.<br />
<br />
We greatly appreciate Attorney Foss Hooper&apos;s professional expertise.<br />

That&apos;s when I learned I didn&apos;t know what I was doing. By the end of the seminar I wanted an appointment to have their professional help. All we had to do was give them our information and they handled everything so our trust was in order and we could relax knowing everything was being taken care of and done properly. Now when the time comes, our children, with minor help of Hooper Law Office, can take care of our estate with minimum time and effort. </p>

                    <p>We learned of Hooper Law through a seminar we attended looking for trust information. We were set up with Peter Harbach and he took us through the process. He explained things very good and was very professional. He met with our children too so they understood. A great experience! Thank you Peter and Staff.</p>

                    <p>Each of us is in our second marriage and we each have 2 grown children. Hooper Law Office helped us develop an estate plan which protects each other while ensuring that our children inherit what is theirs. The staff was consistently helpful, considerate and responsive. It was an easy and enjoyable experience to work with them. We would recommend H.L.O. to anyone. </p>

                    <p>We are nearing retirement age and realize our wills, made when our now adult children were young, needed to be updated. We attended a seminar about retirement at which the speaker stressed the importance of using a specialist for the preparation of wills, and other estate documents. Our son recommended Sarah Kons, an estate planning specialist with Hooper Law Office. We are so glad we consulted her and used her services. She is smart, organized and fully knowledgeable about all aspects of estate planning. She didn&apos;t &quot;sell us&quot; on anything, rather she educated us about our choices after carefully gathering all the facts about our situation. Her guidance and expertise were extremely valuable to us. The price was clearly laid out beforehand and there was no hidden or unexpected fees. She and her staff followed through promptly on every aspect of the plan. We highly recommend Sarah Kons to anyone who wants expert guidance and care with their estate planning.<br />

                    <p>My husband had to go into a nursing home suddenly due to health issues and I was no longer able to care for him at home. Due to the high costs of my husband&apos;s care, I was scared that all of the money we both worked so hard for would be gone within a short period of time. My daughter found Hooper Law Office. We were quickly put into touch with Sarah Kons and Kim Van Den Bosch-Jones. Within a couple of days we were meeting with them to put my finances in order. They were wonderful to work with. They explained everything in a language that I could understand. Because of all of their help assisting with the paperwork, contacting agencies, and setting up accounts, a lot of stress was taken of my shoulders, which I am grateful for. I appreciate all of the time and effort both Sarah and Kim have helped me and my daughter with getting all of our affairs in order. I can&apos;t thank you both enough!</p>

                    <p>My experience with Hooper Law was superior and it was all made possible with how Sarah Kons put me at ease. I was especially worried about the way everything was spelled out in legal terms. Sarah assured me that they would be there for me down the road. This was very comforting to me. This is a very troubling time for me and I am sure that Sarah has set up my trust to make mine and my daughters future much brighter with the loss of my wife and mother in the past six months. To learn Sarah&apos;s compassion all you have to do is read the letter in the office about her wonderful grandma. Sarah and her staff are great, Thanks.</p>
